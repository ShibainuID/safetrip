# TransitShield AI Vision

Event-specific CCTV inference for the TransitShield Live Safety Response workflow.

The MVP supports exactly three human-reviewed events:

- `restricted_zone_intrusion`
- `possible_person_down`
- `crowd_compression`

## Environment

```bash
conda activate bdc2026-dinov3
export PYTHONPATH=src
python -m pytest -q
```

The same commands can be run without activating the shell:

```bash
conda run -n bdc2026-dinov3 env PYTHONPATH=src python -m pytest -q
```

The server has no migration framework. After schema changes, rebuild the ignored hackathon database from the repository root:

```bash
rm server/data/transitshield.db
python server/seed.py
```

## Run one camera

Full inference reads the camera video, runs YOLO/ByteTrack, and writes a reusable track cache:

```bash
python scripts/run_demo_pipeline.py \
  --execution-mode full_ai \
  --camera-config configs/cameras/demo_camera.json \
  --output-root outputs/demo
```

Cached inference reruns the deterministic event rules from a genuine track JSONL produced by `full_ai`:

```bash
python scripts/run_demo_pipeline.py \
  --execution-mode cached_ai \
  --camera-config configs/cameras/demo_camera.json \
  --cache-path outputs/demo/frame-events/platform_b_demo_tracks.jsonl \
  --output-root outputs/demo-cached
```

Manual demo loads a prepared incident JSON. Every non-null evidence path in that file must already exist:

```bash
python scripts/run_demo_pipeline.py \
  --execution-mode manual_demo \
  --camera-config configs/cameras/demo_camera.json \
  --manual-path data/manual-demo/incidents.json \
  --output-root outputs/demo-manual
```

All modes write `incidents.json` and `pipeline_summary.json`. Incident lifecycle fields must satisfy `start <= detected <= end` when an end exists, and `duration_seconds` must match those timestamps. Unavailable evidence media and failed annotated video outputs are reported as `null`, never as paths to files that do not exist. Every incident remains `requires_human_review: true`.

## Run several cameras

```bash
python scripts/run_demo_library.py \
  --camera-config configs/cameras/demo_camera.json \
  --camera-config configs/cameras/man_falls_platform.json \
  --camera-config configs/cameras/crowd_compression_concourse.json \
  --output-root outputs/library
```

Each camera writes to its own directory. The library runner combines their incidents into `outputs/library/incidents.json` without overwriting earlier cameras.

## Replacing the demo videos

The checked-in camera configurations describe the old generated videos. After creating the Tanah Abang clips:

1. replace each `video_path`;
2. set the camera's `enabled_events`;
3. redraw zone polygons against the new frame resolution;
4. calibrate capacity and event thresholds using genuine cached detections;
5. annotate event start/end frames before reporting precision or recall.

Flow production prompts and validation criteria are in `docs/tanah-abang-flow-prompts.md`.
